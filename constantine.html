<i>Constantine</i> begins with the death of Isabel Dodson. Her death is labeled
a suicide, but her sister, NYPD Policewoman Angela Dodson knew her sister was a
devout Catholic and would never end her own life. Suspecting something sinister,
she ends up on the doorstep of John Constantine, a demon hunter and exorcist.
The ensuing chaos threatens all of humanity, and it takes Constantine to hell
and back to save the day.

<b>Josh's notes</b>: This is a sleeper of a movie in my opinion. This was made
before the big DCEU was made in the Wild West days of movie production. This 
period created Green Lantern, which gave a bad rap to all other DC movies of this
period. However, an interesting character like Constantine coupled with Keanu's 
representation of the character makes this a very good movie at the end of the day.
Overall an 8.5/10 movie.
