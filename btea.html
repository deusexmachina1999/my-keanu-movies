<b>Josh's notes</b>: I started watching this movie just to have on in the
background, but it didn't stay that way for long. The most family friendly of the 
movies on this site, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is a 
comedy across history, with the main character's shenanigans
being strong enough to make anybody crack a smile. It's a different
move than most of the ones Keanu does, but it is still a very
good movie. Overall 7.5-8/10 movie.
