<i>Speed</i> centers around Los Angeles S.W.A.T 
Officer Jack Travern, who foils the extortion
plot of a bomber at the beginning of the movie. This causes the bomber, played by Dennis Hopper,
to retaliate against Travern. Hopper's character Howard Payne does this by rigging a city bus
with explosives, making it so that if this bus goes under 50 miles per hour it will explode. 
Travern ends up on this bus, and with the help of Annie Porter (played by Sandra Bullock), the 
LAPD, and the other bus riders he must foil the plot of the rogue bomber and save everyone on
the ill-fated bus.

<b>Josh's notes</b>: Overall this is a solid movie. Plenty of stunts and action throughout, and the
suspense throughout the film keeps you entertained. The casting was pretty good overall, with
Keanu Reeves rightfully snatching the leading role and Sandra Bullock taking the main 
supporting character at the pinacle of her fame.
