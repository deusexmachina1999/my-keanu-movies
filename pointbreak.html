<i>Point Break</i> takes place in Los Angeles, and 
it follows hotshot FBI agent Johnny Utah, who works
in the bank robbery division of the LA FBI field 
office. When he arrives, he learns of The Ex-Presidents,
a group of bank robbers who were seemingly untraceable.
However, Utah's more senior partner on the case, Pappas,
has a theory that the robbers are surfers. The only
way to prove this theory true is for Utah to become a 
surfer himself with hopes that he can find these
prolific bank robbers. But the story isn't that easy, and 
various complications arise that make Utah choose who he wants 
to be, a surfer or an FBI agent.

<b>Josh's notes</b>: I enjoyed this movie much more
than I thought I would. Its surfing elements are 
just as apparent as the gunfights, and the
Ex-Presidents are marketed and shown as a true
criminal machine and not just a bunch of dumb surfers. 
The casting on this movie is reasonable, with Keanu
being cast perfectly and Patrick Swaye still 
riding high off his 80's fame. Overall this is a 
9/10 movie.
