<i>The Matrix</i> is about a man who is living two
lives. In one, his name is Thomas A. Anderson, a 
regular office worker who does his taxes and lives
his life. The second life is that of Neo, a hacker
who is in desperate search of Morpheus, a legend
in the hacking community. His search leads him down
a rabbit hole he could have never dreamed of, 
engulfing him in a war against the machines in the 
real world.

<b>Josh's notes</b>: This was, and still is, one of
my favorite movies of all time. It's plotline is 
perfection, its casting was spectacular, and its 
excecution of the plot is amazing. It is an action
movie that carries philisophical questions with it,
and it explores ideas such as control and free will.
Overall an 11/10 movie, a veritable masterclass in 
cinema.
